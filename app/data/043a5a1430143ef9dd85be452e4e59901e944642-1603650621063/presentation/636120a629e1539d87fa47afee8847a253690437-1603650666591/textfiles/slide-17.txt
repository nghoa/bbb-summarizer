Recap: Formal Languages and
Automata
•  Automata	theory	and	theory	of	formal	languages	are	a	part	of	
theore+cal	computer	science	
•  Their	concepts	originate	in	theore+cal	linguis+cs:	Noam	Chomsky	
is	the	originator	of	the	Chomsky	hierarchy	of	formal	languages	
Why	talk	about	it?	
•  complexity	of	sub-systems	of	natural	language	informs	
complexity	of	automa+c	processing	machinery	
•  Fundamental	results	from	theore+cal	computer	science	have	
direct	implica+ons	on	implementa+ons	for	language	technology	
applica+ons
