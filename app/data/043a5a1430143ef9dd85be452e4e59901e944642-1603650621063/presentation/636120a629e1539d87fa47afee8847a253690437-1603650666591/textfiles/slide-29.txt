Finite State Automaton
Regular	grammars	are	accepted	by	ﬁnite	state	automata.	
A	(determinis+c)	ﬁnite	state	automaton	FSA=(Φ,Σ,δ,S,F)	consists	of:	
•  set	of	states	Φ	
•  input	alphabet	Σ,	disjunct	with	Φ	
•  transi+on	func+on	δ:	Φ×Σ→Φ	
•  one	start	state	S∈Φ	
•  set	of	ﬁnal	states	F⊂Φ		
Regular	languages	cover		
sub-systems	of	language,		
such	as	morphology	and
