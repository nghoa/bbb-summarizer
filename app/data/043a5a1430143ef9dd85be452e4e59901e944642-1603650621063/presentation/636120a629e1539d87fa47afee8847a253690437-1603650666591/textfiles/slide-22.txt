Type-0 grammar: unrestricted
The	mechanism	of	unrestricted	grammars	allows	the	
deﬁni+on	of	very	complex	languages	that	in	turn	need	
very	complex	automata.	Restric+ons	on	the	form	of	
produc+on	rules	lead	to	diﬀerent	types	of	grammars.	
An	unrestricted	formal		
grammar	is	called	Type-0		
grammar	and	can	be	accepted		
by	a	Turing	Machine.		
It	produces	recursively		
enumerable	languages.
