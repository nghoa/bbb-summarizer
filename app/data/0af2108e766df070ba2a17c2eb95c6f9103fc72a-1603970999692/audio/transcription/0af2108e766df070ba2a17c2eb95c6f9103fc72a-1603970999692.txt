you are currently the only person in this conference okay hello everyone so this part of the transcription of presentation I would not ask you the alignment with another kind of presentation which is now made by myself so the reason for us because at gcp thankfully give me access again to myself or to my machine provided the functionality of the Illini functionality we are stopping by uploading the crustacean okay the presentation is currently uploading so let's just wait and see what happens okay great so the presentation was not loaded I will talk a little bit about the presentation and see whether lines a lot I will start without reading Radiology but I will not read I want to watch the presentation just because the alignment would be affected so meaning that if I beat it album on Towanda and it's pretty easy to fall tomorrow to recognize the alarm in between settlers and the station slides therefore I will modify everything which is what I'm saying so the shop. I think it's it's this apart really well just because the Aladdin modest in the end which was configured correctly so that it can align words or sentences that aside so I will also jump around in the presentation just to make sure that the that the alignment n may be recognized that I've jumped out of the topic in back of work stand up we are what are its components sell one of them is the back of change which needs to be trained so that in the end it so hot will it get strength by counting the engrams and normalizing all of its probabilities and can be used to watch a different kind of ejaculation and train their the weight of yeah so knock off body and consists of a specific amount of states which I do have additional State probability distribution it also contains and number of the alphabet which are presents a simple symbols here and if you have a different kind of transition probability switches model here by this function so how about the training of this model works the training is or has a fixed structure and can be optimized eye different parameters according to to what kind of sedation is going to be so usually we are seeing a specific State let's say for example the weather is good so this is an observation and then we need to come back at 8 how does which kind of states are needed so that you have this time off of observation at the end there are different training algorithm out there so we have here we've listed or Alexa it is listed there are listed and the forward backward algorithm the idea is that it starts with random and then we just continue through the training we continue to to choose the parameter is such that the probability of the sequence and it's just freezes so that station we have talked about will be all so I'll put it so here in this life again we've got a solution which was described as an algorithm with the name of expectation maximization and there's argue with them guarantees that that the entropy between sequence in the sequence ante-mortem it's pretty low because the algorithm converts everything to a local maximum which in the area jumping around again this slide is talking about a different problems of training is that the algorithm can't decide for a specific Direction and maybe just maybe get stuck somehow and Jeff and I think the most critical one is that bem just finished local maximum but not the global play jumping around a little bit again with God's different variations of so old that it is described as someone better interest for handling sparsity another one is that there are so many different psychologists just as this land and water and so on yeah jumping around again let's see what you can find keter is every caption about training train where are the probabilities are given different what is a different map of change without probabilities specific training sequence we also need to find out the that's saying that the optimal state of sequence and one of the method is using the interactive approach and heater this problem is solved by using the Kelby algorithm which by the way is also used in this scenario that have talked enough I work at out V meeting Alexa would say and see what the results are
