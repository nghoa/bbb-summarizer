Three Tasks for HMMs
• Given	a	model	defined	by	a	HMM,	how	do	we	efficiently
compute the	probability	of	an	observation	sequence?
• Given	an	observation	sequence	and	a	model	defined	by	a	HMM,	
how	do	we	choose	the	state	sequence that	best	explains	the	
observations?
• Given	an	observation	sequence	and	a	space	of	possible	models	
found	by	varying	model	parameters,	how	do	we	find	the	model	
that	best	explains	the	observation?	This	is	is	called	training of	
the	model.
