Computing the probability
of an observation
• Observation:	sequence	of	symbols	s1s2... sT,	given	
• Naïve	strategy:
– exhaustive	search	of	all	possible	paths	for	that	sequence
– probabilities	of	single	paths:	product	of	transition	probabilities
– probabilities	of	the	observation:	sum	of	single	path	
probabilities	
This	is	obviously	not	efficient	for	long	paths	and	many	bifurcations.	
If	N is	the	number	of	states	and	T the	length	of	the	sequence,	then	
the	computational	complexity	is	O(T*NT)!
