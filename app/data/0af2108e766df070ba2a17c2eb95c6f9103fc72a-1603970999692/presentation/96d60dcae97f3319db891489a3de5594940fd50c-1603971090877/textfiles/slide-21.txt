Solution: Expectation
Maximization (EM)
Top-level	EM	algorithm:
Old_Cross_Entropy=infinite;
Guess HMM Parameters;
New_Cross_Entropy=Re-estimate_Parameters();
While not (Old_Cross_Entropy » New_Cross_Entropy) {
Old_Cross_Entropy=New_Cross_Entropy;
New_Cross_Entropy=Re-estimate_Parameters();
}
If	it	is	guaranteed	that		Re-estimate_Parameters() lowers	
the	cross	entropy	between	sequence	and	HMM,	then	the	EM	
algorithm	converges	to	a	(local)	maximum.
For	HMMs:	re-estimation	procedure	of	iteratively	using	path	
probabilities	to	estimate	transition	probabilities	has	been	proved	by	
Baum	to	lower	cross	entropy	(and	thus	increases	the	probability	of	
the	sequence).
