Hidden Markov Model
A	Hidden	Markov	Model HMM=(Φ,Σ,δ, Π)	consists	of
• finite	set	of	states	Φ = {z0, ... zn}
• initial	state	probability	distribution	Π:πi=P(z1=zi)
• finite	alphabet	Σ={s1, s2, ... , sm } of	input	symbols
• transition function δ:	Φ®(ΣÈ{e})×[0,1]×Φ	
Non-deterministic: several transitions from the same state with the
same input symbol are valid and common.
Normalized over all possible combinations of state sequence and
symbols.
