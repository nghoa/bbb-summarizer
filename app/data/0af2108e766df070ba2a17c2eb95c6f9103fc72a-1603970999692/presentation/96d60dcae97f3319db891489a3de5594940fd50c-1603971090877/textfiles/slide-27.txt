What about the Zeros?
• Minimizing	the	cross	entropy	means:	transitions	that	never	occur	in	the	
training	will	converge	to	0.
• In	the	example	ababb:	sequence	“aa”	never	occurs:	P(N|a,N) goes	to	0	
• Solution:	Smoothing	and	back-off	of	counts
• Longer	training	sequences	always	help,	but	increase	training	time
