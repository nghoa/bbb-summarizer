Finding the best state
sequence: Decoding
We	want	to	find	the	most	likely	complete	path	given	the	observation:
Like	in	the	previous	problem,	we	use	dynamic	programming	and	define	
the	probability	of	the	best	path	to	state	zi after	t symbols:
The	iterative	algorithm	to	solve	this	problem	is	called	the	Viterbi	
algorithm.
