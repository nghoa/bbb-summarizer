Variants of HMMs
• sparsity handling:	parameter	tying	and	tied	states
• allowing	null-emissions
• modeling	of	(continuous)	time	spent	in	a	state
• different	model	topologies:	number	of	states,	structural	zeros,	feed-forward,	…
• automatic	learning	of	topology
• continuous	HMMs:	in	contrast	to	discrete	symbols
• state	emission	vs.	arc-emission
