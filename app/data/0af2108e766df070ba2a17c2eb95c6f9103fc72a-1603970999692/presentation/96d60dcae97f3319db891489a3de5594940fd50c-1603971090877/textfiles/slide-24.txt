Problems of this training
algorithm
• Critical	points:	Algorithm	cannot	decide	for	a	direction	and	gets	
stuck
• if	training	sequence	is	not	representative,	estimated	parameters	
will	be	suboptimal.	This	holds	especially	for	short	sequences
• even	without	critical	points:	algorithm	finds	local	maximum,	not	
the	global	maximum
