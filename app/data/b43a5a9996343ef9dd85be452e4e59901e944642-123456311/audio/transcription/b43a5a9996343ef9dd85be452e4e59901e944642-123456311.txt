okay let's start hello everyone thank you for coming to the testicle methods of language technology this is a lecturer in the master's program specifically designed in English so that the IRS Masters can also participate in the next elections are you going to talk about various aspects of language technology from the algorithmic perspective so we're not going to look at applications we going to look more on the side of how do these algorithms work at their core so you going to start with traditional things like how to model language related things on the Chomsky hierarchy you going to talk about applications in the seat for tagging and how to align Fraser speaking to look at in tax via going to see applications of machine learning such as conditional random Fields generative modelsalso General Motors which have been picking up recently as the standard model of how to do artificial intelligence and general language technology in particular and I have two assistants to teach the practice classes when is Oregon auto parts who is the head of one of the hats of the Basecamp who has not heard of base camp yet okay very good not too many people that was to write the hands check FaceTime with might be a nice idea for you to carry out your own projects not specifically tied to a particular research true. But more like you know OverWatch and codex between message groups on chest your own stuff and we also have the same mom who sitting in the back of conducting thisso if you are in good hair maybe a short introduction so the LT group group over here since October 2016 so it's on a 30-year here and you looking at all aspects off yeah stuff to do with language and how computers can understand language in the world to send a video. Of semantics oh word meaning we do a lot of unsupervised methods like finding structures in texts and finding structures in language in order to operationalize the sinews it send notifications this is done in the cognitive Computing Paradigm which is basically putting the human back into the equation so we're not just going to writing applications for the cycle applications for asking how can we put the human into the process how can we make an assistant that learns from the human ask the human uses the system reachesParadigm that is picking up now but it's not widely seen in you know end-user applications so far and regularly open source software to the community because we believe it's very important to yeah I got the tools ready to advance science unit 1 Reemployment everything but I will Toluca Lake's to but just you know download their stuff and for this we also upload our stuff so everyone can use it okay and the current group situation is that we have for post office in about 6. The students and in case you are particularly interested in particular aspect of language processing fee free to approach as either me or the student assistants were everyone else in the group and we will find someone that matches your interestnow what is language Taino language Technologies let's look at the bird so one part about it is language so what do I mean what language do I mean for new languages of programming languages no I mean natural language is the languages that are spoken that are written that I read that you know sign whatever but languages that we use in human communication and this is quite a big difference so and the eve approach to language technology is to just be implemented Reno from compilers and drum programming languages and how to translate in a programming language statements into machine operations to translate this to Spanish language until it doesn't work that way but why because yeah programming languages are constructed by someone sits down and thinks about how would a good programming language look like but that's not your languageis are naturally grown systems and this comes with a lot of challenges so what you have to do when we know look at that technology side in order to process language is that language is a constantly changing so you might remember the time when the verb to Google does not existent in the Lexicon of the most speakers this came up like in the early 2000s late 1990s and also add a key difference between programming language is synephrine languages there is no clear define semantics so what is the semantics of a programming language it's in the end inspection on the machine but in natural language meaning is what you make of it and you all know miscommunication happens because what you do is you translate whatever you have in your head in a literal stream of of natural language and then the other personpicks up the stream and constructs the whatever you meant reconstruct the concepts and of course there's at least two mismatched as if you don't understand each other and there's many many layers of interpretation for example I could say is it cold or is it just me and what I could mean is please close the window right but this is something that you can only pick up if you if you look in a little bit behind and Beyond the word meaning the meaning of veritas depending on context so you all know this jokes or riddles place where are they and yeah take it back on the fact that some birds mean different things in different contexts and Technologies coping with this and this is what we're going to talk about in this lecture maybe one example to illustrate what I mean by thatwhite language is hard so if you look at example sentences can you see this by the way maybe I could yeah I'm not sure about the light in the camera yeah maybe I can go like this is it still okay for the camera okay so better yeah okay so if you look at like a sentence that are like he said on the river bank account in style vs she went to the bank and took out some money for you it's very easy to understand this but how do you understand this but what you doing you still going from go to call the lexical level to something like a concept level and two different people formalize the constant level differently but I think you can agree that you can easily disambiguate listen to Spirit Lake Bank to the Ford the river vs in the building or organization you are the deals with finances so this is a ambiguity or put it to me on the other hand would be Hafiz synonymy so in these contacts towel and money means the same and of course. How could also mean the stuff that you make. indifferent contacts in this is why it's not as easy as you know just translating one by one every single word and I'll finding a good representation so this is a and b u t t on the on the word level. Do you have any DVDs on all levels of language and they going to look into them because all our technologies have to deal with this okay maybe a little more on what you doing the language Technology Group so it's a rundown of different projects are some of them are more research such as really addressing this problem with meaning how do we find these meanings by analyzing a lot of texting if I saying a lot of texts I mean really a lot of facts of you have a comment for all the kids basically a matter of the internet of the reasonable part of the English internet so to say because the internet is full of crap frankly but you don't see it because it's indexing sense that you don't get it the crap if you have this in our local server and do stuff like that since induction baby find Bank 1 and bank 2 so to say and the question now is how to link this up to full moon Call of Duty is to representations of meeting with a symbolic so they could do reasoning on top of them applications of them things psycho semantic writing I hate this is what's a student has recently submitted PhD sneezes are you actually need you all know the birth process that give you spelling errors and most of you probably have used to features for grammatical error connection but we have put forward as if an antic Correctional semantic paraphrasing so this is something that you can't find yet in end-user applications we also working with companies so we had a lot of project with IBM we currently work with a bunch of Telecom yeah I'm Consulting them and how to use artificial intelligence we also worked with the speaker and finding information in leeks such as snow Panama papers Wikileaks is kind of collections which is an interesting problem because what you're looking for is the needle in the haystack like a newsworthy story here and some students work already know five years ago but you still developing it it's called Tigers attack to go to Target that's like to eat and get a graph of what happened today in the news so people and organizations how they relate to each other and then you can do something like this in Reading as we call it so from the situation that you see there are you already have an idea what's going on then you click and click on these Bubbles and actually get at the original articles so in case you're interested and I'll just play with it and if you have ideas how to extend just talk to us because you can always focus into a project analysis thesis or independent studies whatsoever okay what is the content of his lectern physical methods of language technology so certificate methods as we focus on the methods not too much on the applications and buchana look at the variety of techniques with a focus on statistical and non-statistical I mean data-driven so we're all learning is also statistical in the sense that you build hypothesis on by observation on a lot of data and we can discuss things like a efficiency Effectiveness so what is faster what to expect at salon and for the language technology Parts yes this is what material is its language and it's mostly written language in this excerpt we don't do anything about speech if you would do more about speech we have other elections for that and it sometimes means that we have to adapt previously now algorithms to our material at hand which is language data and sometimes it means that there are techniques to the only making sense in that looks like language the percent of the human genome actually looks like language and maybe it is a language because it has four letters said it's a linear spring and it has some meaning which is a highly concentrated and contextual and we also the look at the evaluation of techniques because as with all things not to pick up intelligence there's no perfect system so the only test system for the better than other systems and how to decide this so you can look at how to formally ever do I tan so we can actually do it that important development in the sense that we can decide whether to change that we have just introduced to our system is worth keeping over the speech of trash it away because it actually harms more than it helps okay I didn't elect are we going to talk about the theory Concepts the algorithm on the practice class smell like hands on so you going to have paper and pencil exercises you going to have some software you can use in order to make stuff happen sometimes you can also read your own programs and so we don't have any restrictions on the language using on the program and covered I'm here using this is more about the core ugliest make things so you can for your own programs you can choose whatever you like there's no we're not going to run you anyways and maybe one thing so in case anything's unclear or you have a comment on stuff you want to ask something I'm very open for internet Interruption some questions so just raise your hand and I'll try to answer your question as soon as I get it yeah if you want to read more than a rather than listen to me there are a couple of books I can recommend so when is the classic Justin Martin speech and language processing book the other one is even more classic Manning and Switzer foundations of statistical natural language processing and there's also a German book on computer Linguistics which is similar to language technology in case you read German better than you read English but these are just another main foundations the basic things and whenever we do something more advanced I'll give the literature in place and most of the literature is actually online freely and yeah these books are all available so what do I want you to learn in this course so that you could decide whether to stay in this course or talk to some other course so I would like you to learn how to understand statistical methods for language processing in detail not just the rough thing but really really step-by-step convey a feeling for language technology applications specialist are going to comment on typical pitfalls so nuby still go to know when a flea go and do something and would run into problems and have to collect later I would like you to learn about this earlier so you can avoid them and then you should have a profound knowledge of how to analyze and how to evaluate the use of language processing in applications and hopefully you find this very nice and maybe you want to do something more transfer that such as a physicist a project whatsoever some information about the practice last so what you going to do with you going to have homework weekly assignments and in the practice last we going to have practice exercises and practice class teachers will develop the solutions with you for this practice class exercises and we have homework exercises which is similar in nature but you're not going to talk about these in the practice class rather be going to provide Solutions after mobile after the deadline of mission has passed and you should get 50%. Points to pass the course and it would be happy to serve as people that actually attend the course usually get like seventy 80% and it's really the case that someone failed it to know just below on the 50% but these two these don't you know slack don't don't skip the first couple of exercises because you will need your points later okay and Lisa Simon's are theoretical practical or Hands-On in a similar fashion as what is talked about in the practice class and some more information so I think this is the Old Link sorry the link should be 77 not 27 but you're not going to cut you down this link anyway because you just cannot log into that Moodle umn Moodle Lebanon Maine uni Hamburg and there you can self enroll into this course and the key you need for this is small it's 2019 it's all uppercase letters to District of medisoft language technology 2019 and there you can find all the slides are usually upload them at least a day before the lecture so in case you want to print them out and scribble on them you can and we also have a participant's forum there are where you are encouraged to ask questions or if there's anything I can see with the homework and you feel like maybe someone else knows it or maybe even ask us this is the best channel to do that because then everyone can see it and we don't have to you know to a lot of communication over hat stool patio stuff it's just a way for you to discuss a quiz you can also do a WhatsApp group and do whatever but this is the one that's what Missy and then you can react to it hey the final exam going to be a standard to a written exam and of course you're going to have to examine appointments on the 25th of July the other one is said the 17th of September and the time's going to stay like this and the room sometimes change to please check stina as a piece of the current room on his knees and one is in her stomach. I don't know where that is and the content is the lecture the exercises and to some extent to reading but we're not going to ask you a question that you can exclusively find in the reading material that a proposed so you should be the reading is just supplementary thing for you to better understand it or maybe to collect you if you come from different backgrounds are there any questions so far okay some practice Lance is going to be one is going to be just after this class with a half hour break and the other one's going to be on Monday so who's going to be in the Monday class who's going to be in today's class who wants to paint classes okay so yeah just change him just go like don't worry about it. Don't I mean it's just three people don't worry about likes Tina whatever station just go to the other ones it's it's fine it's just two classes he can handle this internally if you just want to avoid situations with one class is entirely full and the other one is entirely empty and please try to avoid switching classes because your practice math teacher real get to know you so it's much better if you understand that however if one of the other reasons you can't depend one of them just go to the other one and I told about without letting you know about it okay yeah coming to the topics of this lecture so we're going to start today with formal languages and automata this is something that you all know by the way who is the master program okay who is not in the master program okay yeah so most people are in the master program I can assume foundational knowledge of computer science which includes former language is not, we can be very quick about this is just a repetition then they going to use particular kind of otamatone for computational morphology which is to study of word formation to have words changed so some languages agreement on the endings of his German English doesn't have a lot of Mythology but you have a plural s which is the most logical thing which is the question of assigning labels in sequences which is different than machine learning for single items so it's not basically one picture of the other but it's one word of the other and they coming to see, so this requires other techniques than just a standard classification of protists let me go to look at topic modeling which has a soft clustering algorithm for documents which is very popular also in other Sciences of the social sciences digital Humanities they pick up on these things and we can look at how this works then you're going to look at Mt machine translation how to build a Google translate then going to look at that face two methods which is a particular way of representing data it has advantages and disadvantages we can discuss these then this election distribution of semantics which is characterized the meaning of words by their Global contacts to buy all the contacts the words appear in which is very attractive because of the data-driven Paradigm that just needs a lot of text in order to build meaning representations and on this we going to go a little further and look at this problem of word census and disambiguate okay so this is the display my part and the organizational part are there still no questions amazing okay so you can start to the content so I hope I'm not going to bore you with this one but it's kind of prerequisites to the the the need to know that you understand also like levels of language in the complexity so who does not remember the Thomas Garrity of formal languages and some not so in theoretical computer science you have a Tunnel Town theory and theory of formal languages and basically this comes from a linguist Noam Chomsky this is the guy still alive now he's more like activity left his political for a but he invented generative grammar and escalate the foundations for modern computer science being a linguist so you see that language technology and computer science has more connections than you might have thought maybe and yeah so what's the contribution here is is basically to look at the subsystems of language how complex they are and the complexity is reflected in machines that you need in order to recognize or to generate them which are these automatons order grammer's and yeah so why is this important because you might have a very simple subsystem of language and if you use a too complex for Madison to come fix otamatone maybe it works yeah but you are basically is sacrificing a lot of efficiency because it could be done easier than this is what you look at your two definitions for 24 that to a formal language in this sense is a collection of sentences of find a length or constructed from a planet alphabet of symbols that's what language is already violating this because you don't have infinite sentence length Okay you die before you can finish it the hang of the alphabet of symbols is just not holding up the kids is always to know people are inventing more symbols like who would have thought that a hashtag or an actress that's a good part of every day's total language in a few years ago and this can be regarded as a device that can potentially enumerate all the sentences of a It's associated language and it's basically a function that has a strange language and yeah that's what my grandma says he might remember is a quadruple so what we have here if you have a set of numbers terminals is a finite set of none terminals so these are basically helper constructs that help you construct the structure of these sentences before you actually generate the string of finite terminal symbols and language a language is always consisting of terminal symbols but you have his number and I'll help us in between and we going to have examples in case you don't recall and that we have rules and basically look like this so you have production rules so you have a possibly empty string to a sequence of non-terminal and Tennille symbols and you rewrite them to a possible lie empty string of non-heme North End terminal symbols and in order to start this you need a particular notice a switch is a start symbol interpreted sentence s and then you are going to be rude. Basically take this a sentence for me than to whatever is in the language and then some more up almost stuff so basically we have the notion of derive ability so if a string vs directly drivable from a string you with respect to these rules it means that there is a rule that transforms this string to the other strength which is usually happens on unsub strings then if you do the clean star on this like if it's derivable it means that there is a sequence of rules that transforms a particular string you to a particular string weed and putting this all together if you look at everything that is still drivable from the Starbucks symbol S then this is exactly the form of language that is generated by our grammar yeah and then we have on the other side piece a little machines which would be able to decide whether a given sentence belongs to a given grammar and depending on the complexity of the language and the complexity of its protective grammar we need more or less machinery and this gives rise to the hierarchy. Maybe a high-level pictures of basically what happens if we have a camera to generate say language and the language is accepted or rejected by an automaton of course the more complex this is the month complex will this be and the more complexity you need down here and there are four types just as in this building with the floors that starts with 0 yeah science so gorgeous. And so the type-0 grammar is basically no respect and so is there is no additional restrictions on the roof that are part of the grammar it's just like I gave it in the definition so you have a string of mountains and tunnels and a rule that says okay we can convert this into another string of non Terminals and tunnels and both of them are allowed to be empty right side can do a lot of stuff that stuff empty yeah and the Machine that you need to accept that is a turing machine so it is specifically if it's computable then you can have a turing machine and then this can be accepted language classes called recursively enumerable languages and this is way more complex than natural languages are we going to not look at these but I just mentioned this for completeness type one is a little restriction Taiwan is context-sensitive grammar so the coronavirus grammar in context sensitive if the rooms look like this so either you have an alpha and Gamma context around a 8 year and 8 is a non-terminal symbol and you transform this into a better and this could be any combination of non Terminals and terminals could be empty come PMT because you push the emptiness into an optional rule saying you can have a rule that the starts and goes to empty in this basically make sure you can have the empty words in the grandma. Not as a technicality don't worry about this one but why is it called context-sensitive because you can apply rules in specific contacts in this context are given with his Alpha and Gamma and Alpha and Gamma can be empty but don't have to be empty need for that phone otamatone you need a linear bounded otamatone is basically a turing machine which is going to take me to steak and it's need an input type of computation tape to remember these tapes in the turing machine which is yeah slang for linear factor in the input so turning machines have infinite infinite types of course and hear the complexity is basically respected and effect is that if you can estimate the amount of space you need in order to make this competition tattoo grammar is context-free even more respected so I'm not tell if you don't have context so basically what we do is we have rules on the left hand side you have a single non-terminal and on the right hand side you can generate a string of Terminals and non Terminals and why is it called contact me because you can always replace your non-terminal a with this rule no matter in which context it occurs and these are also called face structure promise because this is what chunky Richmond is hot in the 60s was underlying the syntax of human language so glad that I'm okay and former things so they are close to the click fix a McDonald's close on the union of the nation and the cleanest are so you can like do many of these in sequence you could combine several buns and if you have to contact the Glamorous their Union also is a context-free grammars difference put these for completeness because they don't really live in that it really hurt us in pain and what we talked about you this one you have here your otamatone which is a FANUC control thing so here are the rules somehow I represented and it has an invitation that goes over the info tape and try to accept the language and it has a memory and the memory is organized as a Stack-On on the second could write them both you could symbols and for this you need a few more things so you need a initial sex symbol for your transition relation you not only doing rules that basically transforms what you read here I can come with you right here but also what happens on the SEC and it has a start state of course and it has a set of final States usually so he is a kind of a state machine in there and whenever you reach one of the final states that accept it otherwise it's rejected and how do these things look like they look like this yeah send text please I mean the stuff they teach you at school right now if you have in a sentence like I shot an elephant in my pajamas you can actually drive it structure from this kind of toy grammar and this kind of poor Grandma already illustrates few convention said we using for grammatical processing language technology so first of all what you but know this is okay if you have the bold-faced non-terminal symbols and then we have a terminal symbols which are in this case roots of the language and spit this into a part about the structure of these of the other ones that I C T produced non-terminal sequences out of terminal symbols and feet the Lexicon which basically is responsible for the last level in the same text three classes of birds with respect to Grandma and sometimes called parts of speech and basically this is a lexicon of nouns that Alexa cannot verbs lexicon of prepositions lexicon of the terminals and of course is lexical to be much longer if a real language grammar and of course these structures will be much larger and much more complicated for real languages at the story example grammar here that you know starts with an S symbol Elite once the interpretation is also influenced by linguistic categories to the sentence perfectly generates hear a noun phrase and a verb phrase in a noun phrase can consist of a single noun such as I and the verb phrase consists of a verb and noun phrase and a prepositional phrase the verb be shot as a noun phrase could also be a determiner and a noun at note right is the same symbol so you could have also an elephant. Elephant ear I just the same category like in the tree and the prepositional phrase has a preposition in an ounce size and again we have announced a symbol and yeah so how did we read the sentence here and with this structure the basically when I was shooting the elephant I wore my pajamas but this is just one joke at this point by Groucho Marx from Marx Brothers 30s so he said I shot an elephant in my pajamas probably got into my pajamas I'll never know and so with the same grammar you could also generate this structure which basically a Texas this prepositional in my pajamas part not to the shooting subject but to the elephant which is ambiguous of course when you were at the sentence first and if you didn't know the joke you wouldn't probably have thought that the elephant versus pajamas or pyjamas you do right you have interpretations in your head you physically it doesn't match in this is why you're not considering it however this is a whole different layer of processing so if you only look at grammar the only look at syntax both are equally valid doesn't matter with it's nonsense or not because it's only about syntax so Chomsky Illustrated this with the sentence colorless green ideas sleep furiously and wild doesn't make sense at all but it's grammatically correct and from this see the views that you know there's no statistics and there is this Universal grandma and you had that didn't actually have to see no capacity of syntax as opposed to capacity of semantics and I think he's like ugly wrong with that until this view of mine is shared by many high-profile people so dumb she doesn't understand about sophistic but don't you understand about structure and got this is one ambiguity and be happy send the humidity here already but this little toy grammar so you might want to protect if you had like millions of rules of fear which is normal if you want to model like this like this how many ambiguities he might have down here so this is the hard part about natural language as opposed to programming language in the programming language ever never designed the programming language so that these kind of ambiguities can occur going to happen right here that I just hit the computer should do if you tell him to do but we can't change the language we have to cope with this okay and then to make a complete in the hierarchy if you have type 3 grammar switch a regular languages or left-right linear language is so here are the rules for even simpler so either you can produce a terminal signal symbol out of a long time no see or you can take you a long time to assemble and should you say to end a single I don't know it's string of terminal 3 and a single mom terminal symbol and whether you do the order like this would be left or right linearity expressiveness is just the same so it doesn't make a difference with protective complexity and the effect of the languages these Grandma's been raped and these are regular languages and you all know regular Expressions by so this is the class of languages that you can exactly coat with regular expressions and inductive tense of regular Expressions who has never written a regular expression okay you know it right so basically you can intersect them you can donate them you can do with star and yeah it's just the way you write expressions basically what happens in the background that compiles a finite state automata which is the device to recognize these and these are even more simpler than the tuning machines in the push down Tub Time Machine so you'll have to stay and then you have a input symbol and this basically leads to a different state so basically you have a rule saying okay this is my start State and I didn't put them both then I go to the next state you not be formulating anything in your tape she just go you know step by step and walk through this kind of a Hamilton and some of these states are final and in the notation be going to do final stage look like that was so cool to hear everything is final except this one an author you profess your input issue find yourself in the final State than this, that accepts the input other Weiser protected and systems of language such as most languages mythology and also something is called tongue piercing with you going to look at in a few lectures into the course actually are captured with regular languages and this is why we talk about it because it's actually important to know that for Suffolk Nephrology can compile finite State automata and hear the finest I could come a time that would actually recognize English muffin so if you have some bird like yeah but which one do we take maybe yeah I don't know table then you could accept this as a noun or an detective and then you can say okay maybe we can table eyes and table eyes is a group of course there's a stabilisation which is the act of stabilizing don't make sense of humor defensive cosmetology semantics able to finesse of the world like this captures how English actually does the abbreviation so you know changing the shape of words in order to make them fit in different syntactic contacts maybe adding some meaning which is reflected into in in mythology okay this is the hurricane that was talking about so basically type-0 the recursively enumerable languages that are accepted by turning machines this is everything is computable cuz you all know that I stuff that is not computable but everything that is computed by killing machines and eventually computer since in this class and then we have these contacts pictures of part of it so it's not you know I've been diagram that's overlapping but it's just in the sticks upset and then we have to contact me languages accepted by Donna Summer and then we have the regular language is accepted by finite State automata and between written about it but what you would have to know is that natural language is kind of context weed with a little bit of context tentativeness I know it's not very satisfying for the from the perspective of theory but I mean this is not the language language filter Theory we have to look at the language and see how fair is it and there's some actually would Implement Isa mildly context-sensitive things such as Street and dining grammer's they are also deterministic contacts P Grandma's soda 10 minutes to contact Lee, this is what you want and programming languages because you don't want to have none determinism you don't want to have multiple Alternatives ever because otherwise processing is on defective but you'll be needed for natural language okay so if you learn one thing about this light jackets this one basically yeah programming languages by Design contacts. Fishing Party signal obituaries please define semantics languages yamilee context-sensitive will you have many possible prices for a single sentence in big booty so inherent another tactic level put on all levels even on you know the hearing speaking level and the semantics the interpretation of what this means is just get another layer of the infinite regress of basically communicating messages between people okay, so much for the introductory psychic are there any questions says I'm going to fast please tell me I'm ready when I like re-explain stuff rather than physically you losing track and Anna coming back on Ethan then we can go on with the next one Bridges finite State morphology so we just have learned that morphology soda like a bird formation should be a regular language and hear about in this one is Confucius a kind of stretched transducers that actually can change between the Surface representation of words as we see them in text to a representation that already has these motorcycle markers identified so that later applications can use it because what you doing here is the reflecting the levels of language is known from Linguistics witches phonology morphology syntax semantics pragmatics this place and we basically building pipelines to say first no clean up everything you know about the mythology and the deposit on the pricing model that posted Mario would assume the mythology is already prepared and then produces Paris to semantic small you would assume that there's already a syntactic parts in the performance Samantha corporations and so on so this is basically the first step in a pipeliner in the linguistic a taipan of texts and yeah if you have no question that I have but how do these texts come in there and stuff yeah then go to the wind direction at language processing under that will be also talked about the more technical parts of getting stuff in and the more application oriented parts of what to do with that okay I don't think going to look at the contract trees and I think I yeah I did I take out the Dax I think I took them out because you're going to lose 1 lecture 1st of May is Wednesday so first of May has yeah a public holiday and yeah that's why I cut some content here and there to make it fit okay I'm fine upside morphologies so between mythology with fine estate in the example is fairly regular so let's assume find State Technology is an appropriate way of dealing with it what do we want from a automatic mythology component well we want to have it both ways so we want to have an analysis of a given volume to its morphemes but we also want to have a generation of a given system and the muffler tip markers into the actual surface for me because she only about analyzing text but also about generating text so thank automatic summarization or think chatbots where some complaint has to actually live your life has sex with you realize the response you get on the system okay so what do they mean by that surface form is always stuff that you observed and then you have to be flexible for him and then this is basically then like what exactly Whitney here is actually depending on the Paradigm you follow or depending on you know conventions and I'm not going to teaching you any particular conventions of particular people butts on this level it would be understandable if you have a surface from like runs it could be the stem which is physically the meaning to finding unit of the word run and it is a verb in the present tense in the third person singular this is what I mean with this Marcus the plural of the noun run as in the sentence he scored several home runs in this game will be here now so again and begin with you decide if it's a verb is is now can't do it like largest it could be large as an active adjectives and superlative and the one which doesn't break as regular as the other ones is better which is actually the comparative of good so it's not always the case that would you have here in the seven and what you're happy and the surface form has the same symptoms of lettuce German examples so a lot of verbs in imperfect third person singular in German can also be interpreted as detectives so this is a very regular regular ambiguity in morphology in German who speak German couldn't speak German so for those who don't pick up and ignore that five men. So of course if he can enumerate all the verse of the language and it's a closed control language then this is a final list so we can just do now put this in a hash table and be done right doesn't work because on the one hand you going to copy a lot of the same stuff so this behavior of nouns you have like this third like there's noun plural form is always an s m Wright all of these he just want to have a rule if it's an hour and then you can add an s in most collisions if not now yeah and yeah they might need to do to slow Xs and what else it doesn't work with this place approaches the feminization the unknown variks so if you wrote your birth list and then it's 2002 and the birth to Google appears then you're worthless tails and it happens more than you might think like a people are doing like analysis on social media like Twitter or February activities in producing new birds not only the one for the hashtags this is like intentional but also a new word sentiment language actually everyday is just most of them don't stay but this is just a normal thing to do you want to have something more principles here than just a test and what you can utilize here is what's called a final stage transfuser which is almost a fine except that it has an input and output tape so what is the finest a transducer it has a set of states and these are finite State machine States input alphabet and an output alphabet for the sake of Mythology imagine that yeah maybe this side is the input and decide is the output or maybe this is the input in this is the output for the computer it actually doesn't matter because it goes both ways but yeah this is what it means that you have a set of four states and the Federal phone stays in a position function in the position function basically does the following it looks at the State Fair in and it looks at the input symbol but it can also not look at the input symbol and react on an empty input and then it produces an output symbol but it can also choose to not producing and goes into the next State of the State machine so yeah it's just a fun side of Hamilton but it has two tapes what do you say is an fsp on a second suicide since juices and input string ask Tune-in out the string why if there are conditions or sequence of position to execute starting with a start date of the final state that actually produces to buy seeing the input of x and the class of languages this kind of machinery recognizes is the set of regular relations my license because it's too bad it's not the regular yeah language relations because it's fake input output and actually it's very similar to a regular e92 so you can say if you have ya pairs of drinks that are from respective input and output symbols than they call this a regular relation is a regular relations we can concatenate regular relations you can unite regular relations we can do the clean star so these are the same operations as we had on the fan side of Hamilton regular nothing else you can Union them you can compare the nighttime you can bring closure them this early photos from the definitions but unlike regular languages friends and countrymen Tatian Nissan North but we can do some more stuff you can do more stuff because we are going from one thing to the other so what you can do is we can go north from the Y button by fax inversion no problem why so this is the projection and we can do a composition in a composition is the following you turn something into something else and then you turn this one into the 13th which is basically applying to regular relations after each other and this is what is this composition relation yeah and then you can do identity so if you have a regular language X then has x axis of regular relation for trivial reasons you don't need any big machinery if you can just copy and for two regular languages you can also do cross product so if you have a regular language and then the regular language sting why then all of their combinations can actually be captured by a finance rate computer so that you understand the composition looks like so this would be basically a regular this is another files that can be used to inhibit already see a little bit of notation so you remember from the final State machines that you have States with names and we have finalized states that have a double NBA Fergie I should have Marta business to start state but yeah it's in the q00 those start State and what you had in the finite State machine set a timer is that you have a single symbol on these conditions and in the final seconds to use if you have two symbols which is interpreted as I'm reading an A and I'm riding in a car and I'm going from a shoebox 2:02 to 1 and then I can read as many B's I like riding out as many wise and stay in the final state in the final state so they can reach an amount of accidents and not do anything on the outputs of this afternoon and empty and we can read wise and we would write these in the end and if you combined this you can quickly think about how this could look like some kind of string secret reviews maybe you come up with this one so basically if you can post this and you basically cut out the middleman and composes into a single one then what happens is it throws out the a speech to a and doesn't do anything on the output type and then it directly goes from B to Z because this is what happens while the wife and this example it's pretty clear that this is the compose example of at the compost yeah but there's actually works for all regular relations because regular relations are closed under composition which will be important if you talk about in a large-scale final stations using morphology Alice looking example first so please add German example so for those who don't speak to you no opportunity to learn about you anymore so yeah we have something about so this is about the verbs Barton which means to eat in numata right Austin incubate and hatch and yeah but no capturing the regular German looking for the G and this is something we don't have in English this is life with examples in German here so we could say there's a what is an aesthetic musically it goes from rest and produces okay this is a verb and then it switches in perfect form so past form first yeah first passed and then there's an app which is basically first person singular switch Rustica you could also yeah tons Tuesdays and the same time by using the contestants Edition hear and recognize the eight years and there's various ways of doing that but then what you do with the last key nothing happens here so this is something that does not get accepted in the end but of course you have to keep track of that and maybe another one that uses a Clarity so we have this weird thing about clouds in ecology so there's a boundary and there's boiman which basically you spell the name loud and if you want to go from brown to buy man from Tom for 20 minutes from town to show me which is Tremont song it's the same kind of political pattern so basically you would just call police in the beginning that you are dude you're allowed position then you copy the other ones and then you can eat in the end in order to accept this and this could actually illustrate how you contrast word list so these kind of sentence uses were invented in the sixties seventies where it was actually an issue of quitting a word list on our computer today we can expand these burglars English fanfic most births and you know I don't know mobile phones from back in the days of those really Nation okay and yeah these examples are ready when I mentioned it with this this afternoon position here at the are situations where you have several choices end what to do with these so it would be so much easier if there were no ambiguities it was so much easier if it's worth it to Mystic but language is ambiguous or so you're not going to try to ignore that but the Embrace this have you been raised as a mechanism in order to be able to keep ambiguities around for as long as we need them because what usually happens is that in the Huey Deez get resolved in the end of the process and the end of the closest could mean at the end of the in this case mythology process but it also could mean that be resolved the mythological Beauty at the end of the semantic process much later so we would have to have a Machinery that actually allows us to to keep around these Alternatives until we can decide them and sometimes you can't even decide them so if you see runs without a context it could be an overview Countryside it okay and yeah what is in this context to go to prison in front of set a timer you might remember this is basically it's still accepts the same language but we don't know in retrospect which path we took and it's more complex because different Paths of you know accepting symbols might result in different output Springs the basically but we'd have to keep track of a set of current states and since they opened his output you have to keep track of a set of current output types not to come to the crazy if you think about this is a physical machine except if there is at least one final State reached so if you know do this exercise of keeping track of possible States we are in because it's not the Mystic and Leona. Keep track of them all at the same time it doesn't matter that some of them actually go nowhere it just matters that at least one of them is in the end of the final state so that we can say OK this was successful transition this was accepted this was treated by our otamatone let's do a example with running so we already talked about a run and runs and actually the funny thing is that I run hesiod runs right so we have two forms of run in in the verb form and takoda home run with us Just Cause 2 homeruns we have the same surface forms in the noun face so this is a very simple transducer that would analyze the surface form and return something like the Lexus representation that I showed earlier so basically this just make sure it's run and then it's either run and you have you have to Epsilon so we can reach the site or it's the other one so you can reach this state but we produce either a noun or a verb here and then depending on what it has an S this is like the third person marker in the verb case or the nun third person Mark for English it's either the person or not here we have here Laurel and the newest for single case so what happens if we transfuse this input string receiver runs out of context it's useful to think about this is. And there's actually something that's called the move. Algorithm for actually this is used for contacts 3, so you can also play this for regular languages do you have a belt and maybe this is the read. And this basically keeps track of where we are currently in our input tape and every dog has its respective output type so the red thoughts starts in the star Stadium now it's easing our rights and our and goes to the state and move on and then it doesn't for the you and doesn't with the end and now it becomes interesting because now actually you have to Epsilon Sensations to the. Splits in the sense of what happens if we need a second thoughts here and one. The color to Yellow. Rosa. And the other. Let's keep it red ghost town here and now if you have two different output types because one is actually riding a V and the other one is writing in here which is what you see hip and then what we see here is not excellent condition so whenever we see excellent condition actually if you have a vocation we have a couple of thoughts for the rest of the actually flips into a red and the blue. Speakers but not reading anything not feeling anything that's what this was the situation before and now I'm not reading anything we can just write a singular form for this one which would be the blue. And same appear in the verb friends so now we have four of these okay but now we have to read the S and if we beat the S the green and the blue. Have nowhere to go so basically they fall down the weekend and I'll delete them again and the yellow and red. The BTS they write their respective Market Winchester person on the web case Floral in the known case and this is what we keep around and then we are done here and these are in states that are marked as final so this is why this is the output and now you have the technical means in order to produce these two lexical forms for this one service form in the initial example if you'd like earlier okay and yeah so basically we have two outputs place and yeah I think a little bit about how you would represent this in programming is kind of non-trivial because you always have to like be more up text okay so this is a technicality of the of the final sentence using and what people have made out of this is what is called the two level mythology and morphology is actually if there is no much more research in the computational Nephrology sexy because it's kind of salt because I get my photos to the regular language so it's one of these things to do early in the process because of conversation with Isabel and its people have sat down and compiled the rules for every language and if you ever learn to a foreign language for you then you might remember these tables off for the Nations I don't know who had Latin School for example this is the first one I remember that have like tons of the conditions and tons of kinds of stuff reflect in these things so it's on find everyone has entered everything there is to know about the all the languages that are interesting enough to move them into the interesting in this case has commercial interests not linguistic interest for today so basically nothing much happening here but what is the major feature in the 2G is how to handle this how to handle like multiple of these definitions in a Motorola fashion and this is where are the properties of fire sentence uses a very beneficial for us so I'm producing so far is a single mythology FST so basically we try to hold the entire Muffler dual language in a in one final stage transducer and what I seen you on the sides is basically just small parts of it I thought you could imagine making this for all the words in the language is going to be huge okay and this is just very complex for humans to read in order for humans to manually code and to Express Burleson spelling rules separately having baby regular way of adding Marcus abandon you have acceptance exceptions to that you're not doubling letters so if you want to when I ads I don't know ization birds already ends with an I that you don't want a double that I may be a bad example of German compound noun so if you make those long words like Hostess for hungry or something like that sometimes you have to put an S because I'm about to come from now to properly and the formation is just putting it together in the SS the spelling rule so you will not like split tees and what they call it is the intermediate level so basically you know due to level 26 in going from the surface phone to an intermediate-level which still looks like surface is just the morphemes spelled out as they would be in regular strings and then we going to go from intermediate to the lexical level which is basically these funny markers of floral and third person and stuff the PC and it is actually got up a linguistic information for the people that invented his boss linguist venturing into competition all things because back in the days that were no compression English yet and this is actually a means to keep stuff apart and keep the simpler but in the end like from the technical perspective what you going to do is compiled all these together in one giant Finance rates computer which if you want to print it out it's just covering all the all of the vaults here and you can. It's just too complex but which books like a single machine that we can do it is actually due to the fact that we can do on your composition so basically making three out of two before this earlier its composition and that you can use in certain situations you can use Union okay for those who didn't get this look at an example to buy the baddies whenever it's it's blue grayish it's from the traffic in marching book so you can read it up that so he if you have like the surface form of foxes and this would be the intermediate form taxes is one of these that is not just adding an S if you want to make the plural of fox because Fox how would you say that right so you have to put but actually what happens if you put an S and R & B market here by saying a word and let me go from the surface to the intermediate and then we can analyze this one to the lexical level and the nice part is that spending irregularities have taken care of here and irregularities of morphemes versus lexical Marcus are taking care of here so he appeared you don't have to take into account that the Arbors where you have to put some other letter in order to make the floor as happens because they end with beard stuff that he can't pronounce of the wise on this level it's all going to be the same and yeah and Lisa yeah that's what do that so here is the the fox examples from the lexical I mean the goes both ways that's like sending out from this way but these go from top to down basically if you would want to generate Fox is out of dyslexic representation you would first find your way here in to the fox and then put this as Market here in order to go to the acceptance date and a little bit of a different location so he we don't have columns for the sweating like this but I think you can expect from that and then once you have this one we can consume as much as be like but not the final one and then yeah depending on whether what we see before this carrot symbol so here we have the carrot symbol in a few places whether it's one out of z s or X be don't add any Eeyore device we had to eat and then the 80s and so he is basically the yeah she is the default He Is We generate the e this basically takes care of the NeverBeast find a z and a Sedan EX which is inside the words that you don't care about versus the one that is right before the carrot and then yeah depending on what we on this date we turn right and eat and then we're just be down here so. it would just add an S who is this exactly here isn't there something you could do at home with just of the exercise to could have cuz you're going to have exercise about these things so if you want to walk down the steps here's exactly what the state numbers are in this state diagram that's basically go from here to here and here to here or the other way and this is why it's called like in both ways both ways because it has had a few times yeah you can always invite them you can use them both ways okay and then if he now you have basically the subsystem that captures the language phenomenon off inserting an E when adding a plural s for English nouns depending on the last letter of the movie called the stem which is the and kind of the base of the word who is one step sister vitaquest but we have more mythology subsistence so they can all do them like in a single session and then we can do things I got so basically we have a lexicon FST so basically this is the part that handles what string what input string is what part of speech is the weather tomorrow in the Suburban to expect if these kind of things and then we have the different definition stipulations paradigms you name it whatever it's called in different languages the basically handle these specific subject phenomena and what we can do if we can take all these separately declared this year and intersect them into one giant thing and this is a big Advantage right if you want to like write this down in declarative fashion and you find an error in your I don't know third person point of the blending of French here then you don't have to look at the entire thing to change it you just change your little component here and then Eureka pilot are compiled us it would actually do this intersections in this composition definition of large sections to says when it's Alexa Khan science that influences when is the spelling of intersection of finite sets and sister and then we do a composition so basically compiling listen to a one big thing that yeah beehives in the same way as if he would execute them in a sequence and yeah I said earlier that intersection like the fifties and not closed under intersection this is tuna General case but it's that there's a trick so basically if you keep stuffed equal lengths then you can intersect and the technical trick here is to treat the Epsilon as a regular symbol so that you don't drop stuff whenever you want and not a empty then what happens is that every letter in the one Pape corresponds to every letter to 221 letter and the other type to the length is kept and under same length restriction intersection is actually possible okay panda yeah few more reasons why intersection so this is where the question I had last time when I get to section so this is what happens if I don't have to answer right away I modify the slides and I forgot the next time the Y intersection of Union was the question because it's like intuitive Lee it's just one kind of thing and then there's another kind of thing and it's another kind of thing and they would all play together but it's it's a little different because what would actually is in spelling with the constraints so basically they capture a particular a kind of feeling like think of this Fox News example but they don't constrain the others but they don't apply they don't constrain the others I basically if you have if you were shutting prisoner in the set notation they just make the set a little smaller but just a little smaller because they don't affect the rest of the sets so basically if you want to have the union of all spelling rules what you have to do technically is to intersect the constraints on Sterling okay are there any questions so far okay so where is the stuff applied talked about these days but I still like underlying a lot of the basis technology so you can use this as a lexicon data structure for example of spelling correction although there are simpler methods to not about you could think of funeral rewriting wrong misspelled thing to a correctly spell think you could also use them for everything that is ruled by such as segmentation so segmentation is usually splitting in two sentences in which is the question is where does the word start and where does it end what is actually a word sounds trivial right not trivial at all think of sequences of application and then in the quotation there's a. And then out of the quotation to the? Or you have words that contain special characters like his company that folded or just dissolved interesting the Yahoo spell turn! heart right it's not is it part of the roots yeah definitely but if you go now deeply and success in sentences and Yahoo is the most be converted in sentences does make sense so this is something we can talk about later and also in early days that you stay sitting decoding speech recognition because you can expect this to continue his representations and have some save a file get some fun into some sort of representation that is in the infant tape and what you want to do then is produce food names which is is funny kind of letters that you sometimes see in Lexington said to tell you how to pronounce things if you can actually read them yeah but decoding the speech recognition has been abundant with a 15 since the 80s yeah yeah yeah in principle possible to use this thing so everywhere that you have a fairly regular structure and the situation where you can we have like transform one thing into the other end pack okay and yeah I think you're almost done on time so maybe a fast forward what happens next if you cannot look at a particular kind of search tree next and this kind of search tree is a tree this like very effective for storing dictionary so you might remember these search fees from algorithms and data structure lecturers these things are specialized these things are targeted for what we have in language which is to know find an alphabet but many letters is not binary binary star for language and also some of these could be used for classification tasks such a place for me. How to transform ya morphologically derivative forms into their base form because in the end this Birds mean all the same from a you know how that with effective what's going to be next and once we're done with these search trees vegan yeah also look at the graph I think they're going to do them which is a very efficient way of storing list of words a dictionary just a list. What are the rules in there or not and this is that much more effective than noticed a list of words in Fort Sam play hash table and once we're done with that to be leaving the level of subvert information and go one step further which is language model sign language model is a certificate to wise to decide How likely a sentence is the spec to a background Corpus of many many sentences and this is done while you're looking at word frequencies and the frequencies of sequences of birds and they're also going to see the first and sensation of how the neural network Revolution actually has led to more efficient models and gather basically revolutionize language technology by state so I hope I going to see you next week same time same place thank you all for listening there's one more question today is the first practice Lots yes okay but I don't see you there that's why I see you all next week I hope I like
